<h1>Sputlink Specifications</h1>

<p class="author">Marc Verhagen, Version 2, January 2008</p>


<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>This document lays out how the temporal closure algorithm of
SputLink can be implemented in Python. The old version of SputLink is
implemented in Perl and has two main problems: (i) it does not
integrate optimally with the Tarsqi toolkit and (ii) it cannot be
easily optimized for speed. A Python version is easier to integrate in
the Tarsqi Toolit and makes it possible to achieve serious processing
speed gains by using c extensions. The design is informed by but not
directly based on the Perl version. This second version was written
because the closure composnent has become more and more of a drag on
the processing speed. This is partly the result of the success of
other components. Especially Blinker now creates many more tlinks than
previsouly, which this slows down temporal closure and makes the need
for optimization more urgent. This specification document has more
details on optimizations than the previous one.</p>

<p>The code should run on Python 2.3 on the major operating systems
(Linux, Unix, OSX, Windows) and no extra installs should be
needed. However, C extensions needed for serious optimization are
allowed. The code should be able to run as a stanalone application but
it should be easy to integrate it into the Tarsqi toolkit.</p>

<p>Here is the required functionality:</p>

<ol>
<li> initialize the graph from a TimeML file or a set of TimeML objects
<li> run closure on the graph
<li> run graph reduction on the graph
<li> add another link to the graph
<li> add another event or time to the graph
<li> maintain consistency
  <ul>
    <li> report the sources of an inconsistency
    <li> (optional) allow the user to retract a link that is a source
      of an inconsistency
  </ul>
<li> return the set of links
</ol>

<p>SputLink is to be as independent from the Tarsqi Toolkit as
possible. For example, the graph is separate from the TimeML files or
objects it was created from, that is, if links are added in the graph,
links are not automatically added to the TimeML file or the list of
TimeML objects. The only module from the Tarsqi Tookit that SputLink
can use is the XML parser.</p>


<h2>2. Design</h2>

<p>The main class is called <ex>ConstraintPropagator</ex>. It contains
a graph where the edges form a closed and consistent set of temporal
relations and a queue that contains all relations that have not yet
been added to the graph. The ConstraintPropagator is the only public
class of SputLink, all outside interactions with Sputlink go through
it. Allen's constraint propagation algorithm is implemented on the
graph. The other objects used in SputLink
are <ex>Node</ex>, <ex>Edge</ex> and <ex>Constraint</ex>. I
will now discuss all these classes.


<h3>2.1. ConstraintPropagator</h3>

<p>Although this is the main class, most of the real work is forwarded
to the graph object and many tasks of ConstraintPropagator are mostly
of a bookkeeping nature:</p>

<ol>
<li>reading the input and initializing the graph
<li>reading the composition table from file
<li>maintaining a queue of constraints that need to be added to the
  graph; this includes ordering the queue for merging purposes
<li>translating TimeML relations into Allen relations
<li>translating Allen relations back into TimeML relations
</ol>

<p>ConstraintPropagator has the following instance variables
(listed with the types of their values):</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeee">
  <td colspan="2">ConstraintPropagator &#8212; instance variables

<tr valign="top">
  <td>filename
  <td>None or the name of the file that was loaded

<tr valign="top">
  <td>graph
  <td>a Graph

<tr valign="top">
  <td>pending
  <td>a queue of constraints that are not yet added to the graph

<tr valign="top">
  <td>compositions
  <td>a CompositionTable (which contains the compositions of all pairs
    of constraints)

<tr valign="top">
  <td>intersections
  <td>a table with intersections of relation sets, see
    the section on optimizations for more details

</table>
</blockquote>

<p>A ConstraintPropagator can be initialized from a TimeML file or
from a list of objects (events, timexes and links). In the first case,
the initialization method will use the Tarsqi toolkit
module <ex>docmodel.xml_parser</ex>. In the second case, elements in
the graph and the pending queue are initialized from instances of
the class XmlDocElement. The list of objects does not include
instances of any other class but XmlDocElement. For example, no
instances of EventTag or TimexTag are allowed. This is to avoid
additional dependencies on other Tarsqi Toolkit classes (beyond the
XML Parser). This may have some repercussions on toolkit code using
SputLink in that input to SputLink has to be either read from file or
from the linked list of a previously parsed XML document. In the
latter case, all needed events, times and links need to be in the XML
document.</p>

<p>At initialization, the composition table is read from a file. The
composition table is implemented as an instance of CompositionTable
and it contains the compositions for all pairs of the 28 convex
relations, that is, there are 784 cells. Of those, only 638 cells
contain non-trivial relations (that is, not a disjunction of all
relations). In addition, all events and timexes are added to the graph
as Nodes (this is hidden from the ConstraintPropagator, it simply
hands the XmlDocElements to the graph), and the links are put on the
pending queue as instances of Constraint.</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeee">
  <td colspan="2">ConstraintPropagator &#8212; methods

<tr valign="top">
  <td>__init__()
  <td>Sets the graph to an empty graph and the pending queue to an
    empty queue.

<tr valign="top">
  <td>reset()
  <td>Empties the graph and the queue, but leaves the composition and
    intersection tables as they are.

<tr valign="top">
  <td>setup(comp_file,&nbsp;tml_file)
  <td>Reads the compositions table and exports the compositions to the
    graph. Also reads the TimeML file, sending the events, instances
    and timexes to the graph, and using the tlinks to build the
    pending queue.

<tr valign="top">
  <td>_read_file(filename)
  <td>Opens the file and creates an XmlDocument object, using
    docmodel.xml_parser. Then hands the objects in the file to _load_objects().
    and TLINK tags from the XmlDocument and use them to propulate the
    graph and queue instance variables.

<tr valign="top">
  <td>_load_objects(<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;events,&nbsp;instances,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;times,&nbsp;tlinks)
  <td>Populates graph and queue directly from the lists given. The
    elements on the lists are all XmlDocElements. The events,
    instances and times are forwarded to the graph instance variable,
    the tlinks are put on the pending queue as instance of Constraint.

</table>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that in this table, like the other method tables, does not
list all methods, but just the ones that are either public methods or
methods that implement an important part of the functionality. Private
methods start with a single underscore. The self argument is never
listed.</p>

<p>Constraint propagation is controlled by the add_constraints() and
add_constraint() methods. Constraints from the pending queue are added
to the graph one by one and each time the graph is asked to propagate
the constraint. When the graph initializes itself, it creates edges
between all pairs of nodes. For each edge, the constraint is the
disjunction of all Allen relations, which we implement as the absence
of a constraint. In the course of the whole procedure, constraints can
become more and more specific.</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeee">
  <td colspan="2">ConstraintPropagator &#8212; methods

<tr valign="top">
  <td>add_constraints(force=True)
  <td>All constraints are added to the graph one by one. If an
    inconsistency arises, the method will terminate and return False
    if force=False. If force=True (the default), then the method will
    not terminate but simply continue adding constraints from the
    pending list, but warnings will be printed for each constraint
    that failed to be succesfully added and inconsistence reports are
    available on request). This method repeatedly calls
    add_constraint().

<tr valign="top">
  <td>add_contraint()
  <td>The first constraint is popped off the pending queue and then
    handed over to the graph, calling the propagate() method on the
    graph. The graph propagates the constraint and returns True if
    propagation was succesful and False if it wasn't. In the latter
    case, the graph can be asked what the source of the inconsistency
    was.

<tr valign="top">
  <td>reduce()
  <td>Reduces a closed graph to the minimal graph that is semantically
    equivalent.

</table>
</blockquote>

<p>When constraints are added using add_constraints(), it is assumed
that the constraints on the queue are sorted. It is also assumed that
add_constraints() does not need to filter out constraints, for example
those with a low confidence score. These kinds of functionalities are
taken care of outside of SputLink. The calling module can retrieve the
pending queue, somehow change it, and then set the pending queue:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
cp = ConstraintPropagator()
cp.setup('compositions_file', 'some_file.tml')
constraints = cp.pending
constraints = filter_and_sort(constraints)
cp.pending = constraints
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>A final responsibility of the ConstraintPropagator is to translate
between various types of relations. This task is actually delegated to
a special mappings module. Translating Allen relations back into
TimeML relations is perhaps something that requires a Constraint to
check its history. An Allen equal can be translated into TimeML's
identity, if the equals is derived from two equals that were in fact
identities. This should be recursive.</p>
 

<h3>2.2. Graph</h3>

This class is responsible for maintaining a closed and consistent
graph. Its main task is to implement a version of Allen's constraint
propagation algorithm. I'll first sketch out the algorithm before
venturing into the instance variables and methods defined on
Graph. First some definitions:</p>

<blockquote>
<dl>

  <dt><ex>R(i,j) </ex></dt>
  <dd>a constraint on the temporal relation between nodes i and j,
    that is, a disjunction of Allen relations between the two nodes;
    this notation is for a constraint that was not yet added to the
    graph</dd>

  <dt><ex>E<sub>R</sub>(i,j)</ex></dt>
  <dd>a constraint expressed on edge E between nodes i and j</dd>

  <dt><ex>ToDo</ex></dt>
  <dd>a queue of constraints not yet incoporated in the graph, that
    is, constraints of the form R(i,j)</dd>

</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>With these definitions we can present the algorithm in pseudo code
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
 1.  Propagate( R(i,j) ):
 2.    add R(i,j) to ToDo
 3.    while ToDo is not empty do
 4.      R(i,j) := get next constraint from ToDo
 5.      E<sub>R</sub>(i,j) := R(i,j)
 6.      foreach node k do
 7.        Combine( E<sub>R</sub>(k,j) , Compose(E<sub>R</sub>(k,i),R(i,j)) )
 8.        Combine( E<sub>R</sub>(i,k) , Compose(R(i,j),E<sub>R</sub>(j,k)) )
 9.
10.  Combine( E<sub>R</sub>(i,j), R(i,j) ):
11.    R'(i,j) :=  E<sub>R</sub>(i,j) INTERSECT R(i,j)
12.    if R'(i,j) is empty then
13.      raise InconsistencyError
14.    elsif R'(i,j) SUBSET_OF E<sub>R</sub>(i,j) then
15.      add R'(i,j) to ToDo
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The Propagate() function takes a new constraint R(i,j), adds it to
the graph, and computes the propagation of the new constraint through
the graph. To that end, it initializes the ToDo queue by putting
R(i,j) on it as its sole element. Then, while ToDo is not empty,
constraints of the form R(i,j) are popped of the queue and added to
the graph by setting E<sub>R</sub>(i,j), the constraint on the edge
between i and j, to R(i,j). Then, the algorithm takes all nodes k that
have outgoing edges leading into i or incoming edges coming out of j
(note that this restriction is not printed in line 6, it just takes
all k):</p>

<blockquote>
<img src="images/algorithm1.png" width="300px"/>
</blockquote>

<p>For all these nodes, the algorithm looks up the composition of
E<sub>R</sub>(k,i) and R(i,j)) as well as the composition of R(i,j)
and E<sub>R</sub>(j,k), using the Compose() function. The Combine()
function then takes the composition results and combines them with the
existing constraints E<sub>R</sub>(k,j) and E<sub>R</sub>(i,k)
respectively (see lines 7 and 8). Combine() intersects the constraint
already existing on the edge with the constraint proposed by
composition of two other edges, creating R'(i,j). The workings of
Combine() as called in line 7 is illustrated in the figure below.</p>

<blockquote>
<img src="images/algorithm2.png" width="300px"/>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, R(k,j) is derived by composing the constraints between k and
i with the constraint between i and j. It is then compared with the
constraint already expressed on the edge between k and j, that is,
E<sub>R</sub>(k,j). If R(k,j) is a subset of E<sub>R</sub>(k,j), then
the newly generated constraint is more specific than what already
exists on the graph and R(k,j) is added to the ToDo queue.</p>

<p>An empty intersection indicates an inconsistency, which is always
reported by the graph. In addition, the graph has to restore
consistency by backtraking to the previous consistent state. To that
end, it uses an instance variable named <ex>cycle</ex>, which is
incremented each time Propagate() is called. Restoring the previous
state amounts to removing all constraints added in the current
cycle.</p>

<p>But the backtracking described above is only needed if a graph can
 be in an inconsistent state. Suppose we have the following three
 constraints in the graph: c_i(e1,e2,<), c_j(e2,e3,<), and
 c_k(e1,e3,>). Then, we can derive from c_i and c_j that c_k must be
 <, but it is already set to >. In that case we need to remove either
 the new constraint plus the facts it was derived from or the old one
 (including its ancestors), which may be a bit more complicated than
 the backtracking mechanism outlined above. Such an inconsistency
 however can never occur with the current approach where the graph is
 always consistent and all inconsistencies are caught when adding new
 constraints to the graph using propagate().



<p>A graph has the following instance variables:</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeee">
  <td colspan="2">Graph &#8212; instance variables

<tr valign="top">
  <td>cycle
  <td>an integer

<tr valign="top">
  <td>queue
  <td>a queue of Constraints

<tr valign="top">
  <td>nodes
  <td>a hash of Nodes, indexed on node identifiers (eiid or tid)

<tr valign="top">
  <td>edges
  <td>a two-dimensional array of Edges, indexed on node identifiers

<tr valign="top">
  <td>compositions
  <td>a CompositionTable, the same as the one on ConstraintPropagator

<tr valign="top">
  <td>intersections
  <td>not yet used

</table>
</blockquote>


<p>A graph starts off with a set of Nodes created from a list of
events, instances and timexes given by the ConstraintPropagator. Edges
are created between all pairs of Nodes and have no constraint
associated with them at this stage.</p>


<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeee">
  <td colspan="2">Graph &#8212; methods

<tr valign="top">
  <td>__init__()
  <td>Sets cycle to 0, queue to [] and nodes and edges to {}.

<tr valign="top">
  <td>add_nodes(<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;events,&nbsp;instances,&nbsp;times)
  <td>Initializes the graph by filling in the nodes hash. Also creates
    edges between all node pairs and sets the constraint on those edges
    to the trivial constraint (that is, a disjunction of all Allen
    relations, implemented by the absence of a constraint).

<tr valign="top">
  <td>reset()
  <td>Remove all constraints from the graph.

</table>
</blockquote>


<p>The constraint propagation algorith is implemented by three
methods: propagate(), combine() and compose(). Graph reduction is
implemented by reduce(). This method takes a graph and creates a
minimal graph that can be used to recreated the fully closed
graph. The reduced graph is useful to minimize storage costs but is
mostly there as input to Tango's TBOX representation. Graph reduction
proceeds in four steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>removing all disjunctions
<li>normalizing all constraints
<li>removing all constraints that can be derived by other constraints
<li>collapsing groups of identical nodes
</ol>

<p>Finally, the graph provides a method that returns a list of all
constraints.</p>


<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeee">
  <td colspan="2">Graph &#8212; methods

<tr valign="top">
  <td>propagate(c)
  <td>Propagate a constraint c using the algorith outlined above.

<tr valign="top">
  <td>combine(c1, c2)
  <td>Combines two Constraints expressed on the same Edge.

<tr valign="top">
  <td>compose(r1, r2)
  <td>Lookup the composition of two relation sets in the composition
    table.

<tr valign="top">
  <td>reduce()
  <td>Create a minimal graph.

<tr valign="top">
  <td>get_constraints()
  <td>Returns the set of constraints currently expressed in the graph.

</table>
</blockquote>

<p>Some methods may be added to a later version of SputLink but they
are not required by the currently proposed functionality. These are
methods to add and delete nodes as well a methods to remove edges and
constraints.</p>



<h3>2.3. Node</h3>

<p>Nodes contain the timexes and event instances of the TimeML
document. They keep track of incoming and outgoing edges. Recall that
graph initialization creates edges between all node pairs. The
edges_in and edges_out variables do not contain all edges in or out of
the node, but only those that have actual constraints on them.</p>


<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeee">
  <td colspan="2"> Node &#8212; instance variables

<tr valign="top">
  <td>id
  <td>an eiid or tid

<tr valign="top">
  <td>text
  <td>a string that represents the text marked up by the tag embedded
    in the node

<tr valign="top"><tr valign="top">
  <td>source
  <td>an XmlDocElement or a pair of XmlDocElements

<tr valign="top">
  <td>edges_in
  <td>a hash of edges, indexed on the identifiers of the source nodes

<tr valign="top">
  <td>endges_out
  <td>a hash of edges, indexed on the identifiers of the target nodes

</table>
</blockquote>

<p>The edges_in and edges_out attributes are accessed directly by some
graph methods. Therefore, the only method actually implemented on a
Node is the initialization method. </p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeee">
  <td colspan="2"> Node &#8212; methods

<tr valign="top">
  <td>__init__(<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timex=None,<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;event=None,<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instance=None)
  <td>Initialize a node. Initialization uses either the timex
    parameter or the event and instance parameters. All values are
    XmlDocElements. Takes the id from the timex or the instance and
    sets the source to either the timex or the event-instance pair.

</table>
</blockquote>



<h3>2.4. Edge</h3>


<p>Edges contain the identifiers of the source and target nodes as
well as a pointer to the graph. They containt the constraint expressed
on the graph as well as a history of all previous constraints.</p>


<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeee">
  <td colspan="2"> Edge &#8212; instance variables

<tr valign="top">
  <td>id
  <td>a string, the concatenation of the string representation of two
    node identifiers

<tr valign="top">
  <td>node1
  <td>an eiid or tid, repesenting the id of a node

<tr valign="top">
  <td>node2
  <td>an eiid or tid, repesenting the id of a node

<tr valign="top">
  <td>constraint
  <td>a Constraint

<tr valign="top">
  <td>constraints
  <td>a list of Constraints, ordered on cycleID

<tr valign="top">
  <td>graph
  <td>the Graph that the edge is embedded in

</table>
</blockquote>


<p>Edge methods are all accessors, responsible for retrieving nodes and
relation sets and setting the constraint.</p>


<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeee">
  <td colspan="2"> Edge &#8212; methods

<tr valign="top">
  <td>get_relset()
  <td>returns a string representing the relations on the constraint

<tr valign="top">
  <td>get_node1()
  <td>returns the Node object of the source node

<tr valign="top">
  <td>get_node2()
  <td>returns the Node object of the target node

<tr valign="top">
  <td>add_constraint(c)
  <td>set the constraint attribute and add a Constraint to the list of
  constraints

</table>
</blockquote>



<h3>2.5. Constraint</h3>

<p>Constraints know what edge they are expressed on and in what
closure cycle they were derived. Each constraint has a source, which
is an XmlDocElement (a tlink), a constraint or a pair of constraints,
depending on from what source the constraint was created.</p>


<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeee">
  <td colspan="2"> Constraint &#8212; instance variables

<tr valign="top">
  <td>node1
  <td>an eiid or tid

<tr valign="top">
  <td>node2
  <td>an eiid or tid

<tr valign="top">
  <td>edge
  <td>the id of the edge on which the constraint is expressed

<tr valign="top">
  <td>cycle
  <td>an integer, representing the closure cycle in which the
    constraint was created; the trivial constraints added at
    initialization are all numbered zero

<tr valign="top">
  <td>relset
  <td>a string representing the set of Allen relations that define the
    constraint

<tr valign="top">
  <td>source
  <td>None, an XmlDocElement, a Constraint or a pair of Constraints

<tr valign="top">
  <td>source_type
  <td>'user', 'user-inverted', 'closure', or 'closure-inverted'

<tr valign="top">
  <td>graph
  <td>the graph that the constraint is embedded in

</table>
</blockquote>

<p>There are several ways to initialize a Constraint. The
first is from an XmlDocElement, which occurs when the
ConstraintPropagator first puts all constraints on the ending
queue. The second one is when a new constraint is generated by the
graph's compose() function.


<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeee">
  <td colspan="2"> Constraint &#8212; methods

<tr valign="top">
  <td>__init__()
  <td>Sets node1, node2 and relset.

<tr valign="top">
  <td>get_node1()
  <td>Returns the source node of the constraint.

<tr valign="top">
  <td>get_node2()
  <td>Returns the target node of the constraint.

<tr valign="top">
  <td>get_relset()
  <td>Returns relation set of the constraint.

</table>
</blockquote>



<h3>2.6. Utility Methods</h3>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeee">
  <td colspan="2"> utility methods

<tr valign="top">
  <td>intersect(rel1,&nbsp;rel2)
  <td>Computes the intersection of two sets of Allen relations, both
    sets are given as a string. Returns the intersection as a string,
    the empty string indicates an empty intersection.

<tr valign="top">
  <td>
  <td>

</table>
</blockquote>



<h2>3. Optimizations</h2>

<p>Several kinds of optimizations will be added after a working
prototype has been created. Some are easy and the only reason to wait
with them is that the legacy Perl code did not include them either so
leaving out those optimizations will make it easier to compare
speed. Note that one optimization that is already added to the design
above is the use of the edges_in and edges_out instance variables on
Nodes.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the potential time savings of the
suggestions below have not been measured. Once a Python prototype is
available the could should be profiled; this may suggest other
optimizations.</p>


<h3>3.1. Precompilation of all intersections</h3>

<p>The first optimization is to compile out all possible
intersections. This will create a 27 by 27 lookup table, where rows
and columns are labeled by disjunctions of Allen relations represented
as strings and the cells are the intersections of the 27 allowed sets
of Allen relations.</p>


<h3>3.2. Equivalence classes of Nodes</h3>

Change the type of the source attribute from an XmlDecElement to a
list of XmlDocElements. Two nodes that are connected by a TimeML
relation of identity or simulataneity are considered members of the
same equivalnce class. The one-to-one correspondence between Nodes and
TimeML objects is turned into a one-to-many correspondence, reducing
the size of the graph and the complexity of temporal closure. The text
attribute is changed in the same way as the source attribute.



<h3>3.3. Normalization of relations</h3>

<p>Closure runs on a graph with constraints defined in two directions,
for example, if we have <ex>before(x,y)</ex>, then we also
have <ex>after(y,x)</ex>. Check whether we can do away with half the
links by normalizing all links, similar to the TBOX approach. This
may speed up closure by a factor two.</p>

<p>However, when relations are normalized we would need to expand the
number of composition tables. Currently, the shape of a graph with
[A&nbsp;before&nbsp; B] and [B&nbsp;is_included&nbsp;C] can be
represented as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<img src="images/normalize2a.png" height="35px"/>
</blockquote>

<p>But this is not possible anymore after normalization because
is_included will be replaced by includes and hence the arrow between B
and C has changed direction. As a result, the composition will have to
account for all possible combinations of arrows in an dout of node
B:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr valign="center">
  <td><img src="images/normalize2a.png" height="35px"/>
  <td>&nbsp;
  <td>(in-out)
<tr valign="center">
  <td><img src="images/normalize2b.png" height="36px"/>
  <td>&nbsp;
  <td>(in-in)
<tr valign="center">
  <td><img src="images/normalize2c.png" height="36px"/>
  <td>&nbsp;
  <td>(out-out)
<tr valign="center">
  <td><img src="images/normalize2d.png" height="35px"/>
  <td>&nbsp;
  <td>(out-in)
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>The table for the first case (in-out) is a subset of the existing
composition table and the tables for the other cases can simply be
derived from the original table. I have not yet verified that closure
after normalization is semantically equivalent to closure with
normalization (but would be surprised if it isn't).</p>

<p>One question is whether this split of the composition table is
necessary. Now we check constraints going in both directions:</p>

<blockquote>
<img src="images/normalize3.png" height="130px"/>
&nbsp;
<img src="images/normalize4.png" height="130px"/>
</blockquote>

<p>So the propagate() method on the graph needs to check 2* 4*4 = 16
possibilities, whereas it will be 16 for a normalized graph:</p>

<blockquote>
<img src="images/normalize5.png" height="130px"/>

<p>But couldn't we just use one of the two non-normalized graphs
above? We will not have real normalization, but if we can build a
directed non-cyclic graph perhaps it is not needed to have four
composition tables. This may need to be explored, but it doesn't sound
right.</p>


<h3>3.4. Reference intervals</h3>

<p>The idea here is to use something like Allen's approach to
this. The normalization outlined above is a first necessary step, but
needs to be amended by selectively removing some links that can be
derived by closure. Currently, event after normalization, we can have
a graph like below.</p>

<p>When R(X,Y) is added, all three nodes with edges leading to X need
to be considered. But if Edge(B,X) and Edge(C,X) are removed, and A is
considered a reference interval for B and C, then only one edge
leading into X needs to be considered:</p>

This needs to be seriously investigated.
