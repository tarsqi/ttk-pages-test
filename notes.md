Trying https://tarsqi.github.io/ttk-pages-test/  gave me an error that there is no github site there. So added an `index.html` file and pushed it up. Now the error is 

```
File not found

The site configured at this address does not contain the requested file.

If this is your site, make sure that the filename case matches the URL.
For root URLs (like `http://example.com/`) you must provide an `index.html` file.
```

Then added a `index.md` and then the site worked, but what was then displayed was the `index.html` file so I guess I was not patient enough.
