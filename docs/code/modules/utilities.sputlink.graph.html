<a name="Graph"/><div class="section">class Graph</div>
<pre>

Implements the graph object used in the constraint propagation algorithm.

Instance variable:
   file - the name of the source file
   cycle - an integer
   queue - a list of Constraints
   nodes - a hash of Nodes, indexed on node identifiers
   edges - a hashs of hashes of Edges, indexed on node identifiers
   compositions - a CompositionTable</pre>

<blockquote>
<h3>Public Functions</h3>
<pre>
<div class=function>__init__(self)</div>
Initialize an empty graph, with empty queue, node list and edges
hash.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>add_nodes(self, events, instances, timexes)</div>
Adds the events/instances and timexes to the nodes table. Also
initializes the edges table now that all nodes are known.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>get_edges(self)</div>
Return all edges that have a constraint on them.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>pp(self, filename)</div>
Print the graph to an HTML table in filename.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>pp_nodes(self)</div>
Print all nodes with their edges_in and edges_out attributes to
standard output.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>propagate(self, constraint)</div>
Propagate the constraint through the graph, using Allen's
constraint propagation algorithm.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>reduce(self)</div>
Create a minimal graph, removing disjunctions, normalizing
relations, removing all constraints that can be derived, and
collapsing equivalence classes.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>remove_node(self, id)</div>
Remove a node from the graph. Involves removing the node from the
nodes hash, removing the node's column and row in the edges
array and removing the node from edges_in and edges_out
attributes of other nodes.</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3>Private Functions</h3>
<pre>
<div class=function>_OLD_get_edge(self, node1, node2)</div>
Return the edge from node1 to node2.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_add_constraint_to_edge(self, constraint, edge)</div>
This method links a constraints to its edge by retrieving the edge
from the graph, adding the constraint to this edge, and
setting the edge attribute on the constraint.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_add_constraint_to_queue(self, edge, relset, c1, c2)</div>
</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_check_i_j_k(self, edge_i_j, edge_j_k, node_i, node_j)</div>
Look at the i-&gt;j-&gt;k subgraph and check whether the new constraint
in Edge(i,j) allows you to derive something new by
composition. The nodes node_i and node_j could be derived from
edge_i_j but are handed to this function because they were
already available and it saves a bit of time this way.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_check_k_i_j(self, edge_k_i, edge_i_j, node_i, node_j)</div>
Look at the k-&gt;i-&gt;j subgraph and check whether the new constraint
in Edge(i,j) allows you to derive something new by
composition. The nodes node_i and node_j could be derived from
edge_i_j but are handed to this function because they were
already available and it saves a bit of time this way.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_collapse_equivalence_classes(self)</div>
</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_combine(self, edge, relset, c1, c2)</div>
Compare the relation set on the edge to the relation set created by
composition. Creates the intersection of the relation sets and
checks the result: (i) inconsistency, (ii) more specific than
relation set on edge, or (iii) something else. The alrgument
c1 and c2 are the constraints that were composed to create
relset and will be used to set the history on a new constraint
if it is created.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_compose(self, object1, object2)</div>
Return the composition of the relation sets on the two objects. One
object is an edge, the other a Constraint. Once the relations
are retrieved from the objects all that's needed is a simple
lookup in the compositions table.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_get_edge(self, node1, node2)</div>
Return the edge from node1 to node2.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_intersect_constraints(self, edge, constraint)</div>
Intersect the constraint that was just derived to the one already
on the edge. There are three cases. (1) The new constraint, if
it is the one originally handed to the propagate() function,
could introduce an inconsistency, this should be reported
(***which is not done yet***). (2) The new constraint could be
identical to the one already there and can be ignored. (3) The
new constraint is more specifc than the already existing
constraint. The method returns False in the first two cases
and the intersection in the last case.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_normalize_relations(self)</div>
Remove all relations that are not in the set of normalized
relations.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_remove_derivable_relations(self)</div>
First mark and then remove all constraints that can be derived.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_remove_disjunctions(self)</div>
Remove all disjunctions from the graph.</pre>

<div class=function>invert_interval_relations(relations)</div>
Take a disjunction of interval relations represented as a string,
replace each disjunct with its inverse and return the result.</pre>
