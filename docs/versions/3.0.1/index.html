<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>The Tarsqi Toolkit (also referred to here as TTK or the Toolkit) is a set of
components for extracting temporal information from news wire texts. TTK
extracts time expressions, events, subordination links and temporal links; in
addition, it can ensure consistency of temporal information.</p>

<p>The first version of the toolkit, version 1.0, was released in 2007,
accompanied by many promises and threats that there would be a new version soon,
but the release of the next version happened to take a decade. Version 2.0.0 was
finally released in March 2017 and it differed from version 1.0 in many
respects: code was simplified and debugged, documentation was updated, the
Mallet toolkit was used, stand-off annotation was adopted, libraries were
redesigned, and test and evaluation code was added. Up to version 2.2.0 only
Python 2.7 was supported. Version 2.2.1 and version 3.0.0 were the first
versions to also support Python 3 (this was tested on Python 3.8.5). Versions
2.2.1 and 3.0.0 are almost identical, the only differences are in the
documentation and some bookkeeping files like the top-level VERSION file. After
version 3.0.0, Python 2.7 support is not pursued anymore and future
compatibility with Python 2.7 will be accidental. A list of changes is
maintained in
the <a href="https://github.com/tarsqi/ttk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a>
on GitHub.</p>

<p>The current version 3.0.1 has few code changes and is mostly concerned with
publishing documentation on GitHub Pages.</p>


<a name="prereq"></a>

<h2>2. Requirements and Installation</h2>

<p>The toolkit runs on recent versions of Linux and Mac OSX (and should run on
Windows, but see below). The code requires Python version 2.7 or version 3.8
(perhaps older versions are fine, this was not tested yet), Perl version 5.8 or
newer and the Java Development Kit version 8 (version 7 will probably work as
well). Java is needed to run the third party software used by the toolkit.</p>

<p>Two Python packages need to be installed:</p>

<pre class="example">
$ pip install future
$ pip install six
</pre>


<p>With the requirements in place installation is a four step process:</p>

<ol>

  <li>
    <p>Install the toolkit code. This is simply a matter of unpacking the
    downloaded archive or cloning the TTK Git repository
    at <a href="https://github.com/tarsqi/ttk.git">https://github.com/tarsqi/ttk.git</a>. Due
    to a <a href="https://github.com/tarsqi/ttk/issues/42">bug</a> on Windows,
    you should aim to install the toolkit on a path without spaces.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Install the part-of-speech tagger. The Tarsqi toolkit is designed to work
      seamlessly with the IMS TreeTagger. Download the packages needed for your
      platform from
      the <a href="http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/">TreeTagger
      website</a> and follow the directions. You can install the TreeTagger
      wherever you like, but you may need to tell the Toolkit where it can find
      the tagger (see below). There is an
      <a href="build/install-treetagger-osx.sh">example script</a> in the
      <code>build</code> directory which shows how to install the TreeTagger on
      Mac OSX. (Note: all directory and file names printed in this manual are
      relative to the path where TTK is installed).</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Install MALLET. The classifiers in the Toolkit use the MAchine Learning
      for LanguagE Toolkit (McCallum, Andrew Kachites. <i>MALLET: A Machine
      Learning for Language Toolkit.</i>
      <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu">http://mallet.cs.umass.edu</a>. 2002). Download
      version 2.0.8
      from <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php">http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php</a>. Version
      2.0.7 will work as well. You can put MALLET wherever you want, but as with
      the TreeTagger you may need to tell the Toolkit where to find it. There is
      an <a href="build/install-mallet-osx.sh"> example script</a> in the
      <code>build</code> directory which shows how to install MALLET on Mac
      OSX. For Windows, you need to set the MALLET_HOME environment variable in
      addition to editing the configuration file.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Create the configuration file. The toolkit comes with an example configuration file
      in <code>config.sample.txt</code>. Copy that file into
      <code>config.txt</code> and edit as needed. In most cases, the only
      settings in the configuration file that you will need to change are
      the <code>treetagger</code> and <code>mallet</code> options, with the
      values depending on where you installed the TreeTagger and MALLET. If you
      use the same installation directories as the two example scripts mentioned
      above then you will not have to make any changes to the configuration
      file.</p>
  </li>

</ol>

<p>To test the toolkit open a terminal window and make sure your working
directory is in the top-level directory of the distribution, then type
the following at the prompt (we use the dollar sign as the prompt in all
examples):</p>

<pre class="example">
$ python tarsqi.py data/in/simple-xml/tiny.xml out.xml
</pre>

<p>If all is well you will now have a file named <code>out.xml</code> with
  content similar to the output printed below.</p>

<pre class="example">
&lt;ttk>
&lt;text>

&lt;/text>
&lt;metadata>

  &lt;/processing_steps>
&lt;/metadata>

         relType="INCLUDES" relatedToEventInstance="ei1" timeID="t1" />
&lt;/tarsqi_tags>
&lt;/ttk>
</pre>

<p>Your output file will not be identical to this in that some dates and
identifiers in the metadata will be different. There will also be minor format
changes because some tags were put on two lines above for display purposes (TTK
output has each tag on one line).</p>

<p><u>A note for Windows users</u>. The code should run on Windows and we know
it actually does run on Windows. However, we have not done extensive testing on
Windows and some of the above instructions may not be entirely correct for
Windows.</p>

<h2>3. Using the TARSQI Toolkit</h2>

<p>To run the TARSQI Toolkit, open a terminal and change the working directory
to the top-level directory of the distribution. You can run Tarsqi on a file or
a directory and the general format of the command is as follows:</p>

<pre class="example">
$ python tarsqi.py [OPTIONS] INFILE OUTFILE
$ python tarsqi.py [OPTIONS] INDIR OUTDIR
</pre>

<p>In the first invocation INFILE needs to exist but OUTFILE should not. In the
second invocation INDIR has to be a directory and OUTDIR either should not
exist, in which case it is created, or it should be a directory. In the latter
case you will be asked to confirm whether it is okay to overwrite files in
OUTDIR, if not, the program will exit. All files in INDIR will be processed
except for hidden files (starting with '.') and backup files (ending in '~').</p>

<p>There are several options you can use, none of them are mandatory. Options
can be set in the configuration file (<code>config.txt</code>) or overruled on
the command line. For a full list see the configuration file and the module
documentation string in the main <code>tarsqi.py</code> script. Here we just
present the three options you are most likely to use.</p>

<p><code>--source-format xml|text|ttk|timebank|...</code></p>

<div class="indent">

<p>The source type of the document allows components, especially the source
parser and the metadata parser, to be sensitive to idiosyncratic properties of
the text. There are three main types: <code>xml</code>, <code>text</code>
and <code>ttk</code>. With the <code>xml</code> type the toolkit will assume
that the input is well-formed XML and it will separate the text and the
tags. The text is input for Tarsqi processing and the XML tags will be put in a
separate tag repository. This input type can be used for the files
in <code>data/in/simple-xml</code>. The <code>text</code> type makes the toolkit
assume that the entire content of the file is to be parsed. Since the toolkit
does not try to recognize any tags this type should only be used for real raw
text. The <code>ttk</code> source type tells the toolkit that the input is in
the TTK format. Typically the input here would be a file previously processed
by the toolkit or a file that was converted into the TTK format.</p>

<p>The toolkit will usually run just fine without
the <code>--source-format</code> option. In that case the toolkit will make an
educated guess as to whether the input is <code>xml</code>, <code>text</code>
or <code>ttk</code>. The system can be tricked, for example by giving it a file
where the beginning really looks like XML, but in those cases an error will
usually follow and in those cases it would be prudent to use this option after
all.</p>

<p>The option should always be used when one of the special formats are
used. When the input is vanilla text or XML then the toolkit has no good way to
determine properties that are expressed in a very idiosyncratic way like the
document creation time (DCT) and it will simply default to today's
date. The <code>timebank</code> source type is an example of a specific source
type. When using this for one of the files in <code>data/in/TimeBank</code> the
toolkit will know where to find the DCT, which in the TimeBank case is in the
file name or in some tag in the input.</p>

<p>The output of the processing is always in the TTK format, an example of which
was given above when we processed <code>data/in/simple-xml/tiny.xml</code>. The
TTK format is a standoff format which contains both the original unaltered text
as well as the tags added and it contains four main elements:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>The <code>text</code> tag with in it the primary data of the input. In the
case of the <code>text</code> type this is simply the entire document, for
the <code>xml</code> type it is the document with all tags stripped (note that
this implies that for the <code>xml</code> type we consider the primary source
the document without the XML tags).</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>metadata</code> tag which has a dictionary with meta data, which
at this point only contains the value of the DCT.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>source_tags</code> tag which has all tags that were available in
the input, this is by definition empty for the <code>text</code> type.</p></li>

<li><p>The <code>tarsqi_tags</code> tag which contains a flat list of all tags added by the
toolkit.</p></li>

</ol>

</div>

<!--
<code>timebank</code>
<blockquote>
This input type is very similar to <code>simple-xml</code>, the main
difference is that it activates a component that parses document
creation times for the various TimeBank formats. This input type can
be used for the files in <code>data/in/TimeBank</code>, which
consists of all TimeBank files with all tags (except some document
level tags) stripped out.  
</blockquote>

<code>rte3</code>
<blockquote>
Use this input type when processing pre-processed data from
<code>data/in/RTE3</code>, which contains data from the <a
href="http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE3/">Third Pascal
Textual Entailment Challenge</a>. 
</blockquote>
-->


<p><code>--dct TIMEX_VALUE</code></p>

<div class="indent">

<p>This can be used to hand in a DCT so that you are not faced with a situation
where all DCTs are set to today's date. You may have a series of documents that
you want to parse and that have their own particular format where the DCT is
expressed in some way. You could extend the toolkit and define new data types
and write metadata parsers for that data type. Or you could do that processing
off-line and simply feed it into the toolkit with this option. The value needs
to be a normalized time value like 20170412 (for April 12th 2017).</p>

</div>


<p><code>--pipeline STRING</code></p>

<div class="indent">

<p>Can be used to overrule the default pipeline specified in
the <code>config.txt</code> settings file. A pipeline is a comma-separated
string of component names. Allowed component names are <code>PREPROCESSOR,
TOKENIZER, TAGGER, CHUNKER, GUTIME, EVITA, SLINKET, S2T, BLINKER,
CLASSIFIER</code> and
<code>LINK_MERGER</code>. Using other names raises an error. The order of the
components in the pipeline specification is significant. Some pipeline examples
are:</p>

<pre class="example">
--pipeline PREPROCESSOR,GUTIME,EVITA
--pipeline TOKENIZER,TAGGER,CHUNKER,GUTIME,EVITA
--pipeline SLINKET,S2T,BLINKER,CLASSIFIER,LINK_MERGER
--pipeline PREPROCESSOR,GUTIME,EVITA,SLINKET,S2T,BLINKER,CLASSIFIER
</pre>

<p>The first example instructs TTK to take a file, preprocess it and add time
expressions and events. The second example is identical except that individual
preprocessing modules are used instead of the PREPROCESSOR shorthand. It is
worth noting that you should not combine PREPROCESSOR and TOKENIZER in one
pipeline since you would then run the tokenizer twice and this will cause errors
later in the processing chain. For the third example, preprocessing, times and
events are taken for granted and only links are added. In this case the input
needs to be a ttk file which has the needed information. The fourth example is
the full pipeline except that the link merger component is left out, this
is useful for large files since the merger component slows down on large
file. This is in fact the default pipeline.</p>

</div>


<p>To end this section here is an example to illustrate the interaction of
the <code>--source-format</code> and <code>--pipeline</code> options:</p>

<pre class="example">
$ python tarsqi.py --source-format xml --pipeline TOKENIZER test.xml test.tokenized.xml
$ python tarsqi.py --source-format ttk --pipeline TAGGER test.tokenized.xml test.tagged.xml
</pre>

<p>Note how the second line uses the ttk source type because output is always in
the TTK format. You could leave out the <code>--source-format</code> option and
let the toolkit determine the source from the input file.</p>

<h2>4. Further Documentation</h2>

<p>The <a href="../../code/index.html">code documentation</a> has a list of
links to all modules. For each module the documentation strings for classes and
functions are printed. Documentation of the code is uneven: some modules are
well-documented, other have spotty and underwhelming documentation or are not
documented at all. The pages were automatically generated with the
<code>make_documentation.py</code> script in the <code>utilities</code>
directory, which was created because the <code>pydoc</code> command crashes on
many of the toolkit modules.</p>

<p>Several <a href="../../design/index.html">design documents</a> contain
notes on the overall design of the toolkit and the algorithms used in many
components. These notes are a work in progress and many sections are
unfinished. The end of the <a href="../../design/1-toplevel.html">top-level
design document</a> includes a list of tags generated by the toolkit.</p>

<p>The are also <a href="../../notes/index.html">various random notes</a> on the
Tarsqi toolkit including descriptions of parts of the system, how-to guides and
old specifications. Some are fairly recent, some are very old. The recent ones
tend to be written in Github flavoured markdown and are best viewed
on <a href="https://github.com/tarsqi/ttk/tree/master/docs/notes">Github</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a list of <a href="../../papers/index.html">published
papers</a> on Tarsqi.</p>

<h2>7. Known Issues</h2>

<li>Bad CPU type in executable

<p>This error may be thrown by the bin/tree-tagger executable in the treetagger
directory. You have the wrong executable. Install the correct version for your
operating system.</p>

<li>TreeTagger parameter file invalid: english.par

<p>This is thrown by components.preprocessing.treetaggerwrapper.TreeTaggerError
and it can occur when your versions of the treetagger and the treetaggerwrapper
script are out of sync. Find the line

<blockquote>
"tagparfile": "english.par",
</blockquote>

and replace it with

<blockquote>
"tagparfile": "english-utf8.par",
</blockquote>

Note that this should really be fixed by using the new treetaggerwrapper.</p>
