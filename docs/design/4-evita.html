<h2>Evita and the TarsqiTree class</h2>

<p>The EvitaWrapper class is handed the TarsqiDocument and loops over all
docelement Tags in it, creating an Evita instance for each of them and then
procesing the elements one by one. The Evita instance has slots for the
TarsqiDocument, the docelement tag and a TarsqiTree instance which contains a
document tree for the part of the TarsqiDocument that is being processed. The
TarsqiTree instance itself knows what TarsqiDocument it belongs to and what
docelement Tag it was created for since these were handed in from the Evita
instance. The TarsqiTree instance also has a list of daughters as well as some
other attributes that are ignored here because they are not used by Evita.</p>

<table class="pythonclass indent spacy">

	<td>a list of daughters, typically instances of Sentence</td>
      </tr>

<p>Since the TarsqiTree and its elements are the starting point for Evita and
Slinket processing we will dwell on them a bit longer. Here is a pretty print of
the TarsqiTree for "The dog barked yesterday.".</p>

<pre class="example indent">
&lt;Sentence position=0>
  &lt;NounChunk position=0 checkedEvents=False event=None eid=None>
    &lt;Token position=0 pos=DT text=The>
    &lt;Token position=1 pos=NN text=dog>
  &lt;VerbChunk position=1 checkedEvents=False event=None eid=None>
    &lt;Token position=0 pos=VBD text=barked>
  &lt;NounChunk position=2 checkedEvents=False event=None eid=None>
    &lt;TIMEX3 tid=t1 type=DATE value=20160103>
      &lt;Token position=0 pos=NN text=yesterday>
  &lt;Token position=3 pos=. text=.>
</pre>

<p>A TarsqiTree contains sentences, chunks, tokens and event and time
constituents. It is created from a TarsqiDocument and a Tag by the create_tarsqi_tree() method in
components.common_modules.tree. This method uses the intermediary Node object to
create a tree hierarchy and then replaces all Node objects with instances of
Sentence, NounChunk, VerbChunk, Token, AdjectiveToken, EventTag and TimexTag
(all defined in submodules of components.common_modules). These tree elements
are all subclasses of Constituent and have the following instance variables:</p>

<table class="pythonclass indent spacy">
  <tr>
    <td class="name" colspan="2">components.common_modules.constituent.Constituent</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>tree</td>
    <td>contains the TarsqiTree instance at the top of the tree, through this
    tree a constituent also has access to the TarsqiDocument and the Tag</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>parent</td>
    <td>a reference to the parent, which is an instance of TarsqiTree or one of
      the subclasses of Constituent</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>position</td>
    <td>an integer reflecting the constituent's position in the dtrs list of the
    parent</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>dtrs</td>
    <td>a list of daughters, this is the empty list for leaf nodes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>begin</td>
    <td>the beginning offset in the SourceDoc</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>end</td>
    <td>the ending offset in the SourceDoc</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The TarsqiTree is used by Tarsqi components as a common data structure to
process over. For example, Evita and Slinket both run patterns over elements of
this tree and major parts of the Evita and Slinket code are expressed as methods
on constituents. Components may update elements of the tree, but it is important
to note that those changes are local and will not be handed over to a next
component in the pipeline. Instead, results from processing have to be exported
to the TagRepository on the TarsqiDocument, as in the following figure.</p>

<img src="images/component.png" width="650"/>

<p>Components import the TarsqiDocument and for each Tag create a TarsqiTree
using the TarsqiDocument's data. They then use this sequence of trees one by
one as input to processing and export the resulting tags back into the
TagRepository. The next component in the pipeline will start afresh with a new
set of TarsqiTrees which will be created from the updated TarsqiDocument.</p>

<p>Back to Evita...</p>

<p>The EvitaWrapper takes the TarsqiDocument on initialization and its process()
method loops over all document elements, creating an Evita instance for each of
them and then running the process_element() method. The process_elements()
method loops through all Sentence instances in the TarsqiTree in Evita's doctree
variable, and then loops through all daughters of the Sentence. For each
daughter it attempts to create an event with the createEvent() method, which is
implemented on the NounChunk and VerbChunk classes.</p>

<p>As an illustration, below is a fragment from the code in the Evita class in
components.evita.main. Note that the code is slightly simplified and edited and
that it is not well-formed Python code anymore, this is true for all code
fragments shown in this document.</p>

<pre class="example indent">
<i>components.evita.main.Evita</i>

process_element():
   self.doctree = create_tarsqi_tree(self.tarsqidoc, self.docelement)
   for sentence in self.doctree:
      for node in sentence:
         if not node.checkedEvents:
            node.createEvent()
</pre>

<p>Nominal events are created with createEvent() on NounChunk and verbal and
adjectival events are created with createEvent() on VerbChunk. Adjectival events
are initially dealt with by VerbChunk because they are created only if preceded
by certain verb groups, which is recognized by VerbChunk. The following three
sections give details on how the three kinds of events are created.</p>


<a name="nouns"/>
<h2>Nominal events</h2>

<p>Most of the code that deals with nominal events is expressed on the NounChunk
class, which is a sublass of Chunk and Constituent. Recall that Constituent
defines instance variables tree, parent, position, dtrs, being and end. These
are all filled in during TarsqiTree construction by create_tarsqi_tree(), as
mentioned earlier in this section. Several other instance variables are defined
on chunks. The table below has just the variables added by NounChunk that are
relevant for Evita.</p>

<table class="pythonclass indent spacy">
  <tr>
    <td class="name" colspan="2">components.common_modules.chunks.NounChunk</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>phraseType</td>
    <td>the chunktype, basically the chunk tag generated by the chunker, always
    'ng' for noun chunks</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>head</td>
    <td>an integer reflecting the position of the head token in the chunk's dtrs
    variable, always set to -1 for noun chunks, picking out the last element</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>gramchunk</td>
    <td>
      <table class="pythonclass embedded">
	<tr>
	  <td class="name" colspan="2">components.evita.gramChunk.GramNChunk</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>node</td>
	  <td>the NounChunk that the features are for</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>tense</td>
	  <td>the tense of the nominal, by default set to 'NONE'</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>aspect</td>
	  <td>the aspect of the nominal, by default set to 'NONE'</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>modality</td>
	  <td>the modality of the nominal, by default set to 'NONE'</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>polarity</td>
	  <td>the polarity of the nominal, by default set to 'POS'</td>
	</tr>
      </table>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>gramchunks</td>
    <td>the empty list for noun chunks, but can be non-empty for verb chunks</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>checkedEvents</td>
    <td>a flag indicating whether the chunk has already been checked for events,
    initially set to False; if set to True, createEvent() will never be run for
    the chunk</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The GramNChunk instance in the gramchunk variable contains the grammatical
features for the noun chunk. This instance has a pointer back to the NounChunk
it is in and four grammatical features. Three of them are typically 'NONE' for
nouns, and it may sound a wee bit odd for nouns to have tense, aspect or
modality, but in some cases the nominal will inherit these from a governing
verb, for example, with phrases like "This would be a tragedy". When the verb
chunk "be" tries to create an event it will recognize that the actual event is
the nominal following it, it will then try to create an event on that nominal
and hand it the verb chunk features. This is explanined further below in the
section on verbal events.</p>

<p>The top-level of the createEvent() code for nominals looks as follows:</p>

<pre class="example indent">
<i>components.common_modules.chunks.NounChunk</i>

createEvent(self, gramvchunk=None):
   self.gramchunk = GramNChunk(self, gramvchunk)
   if self.isEventCandidate():
      self._conditionallyAddEvent()
</pre>

<p>GramNChunk creation for the NounChunk is a simple affair, setting the
defaults and then leting them be overwritten if features were handed in from the
governing verb. The main work occurs in the isEventCandidate() method on the
chunk, which first checks whether the noun chunk is syntactically able to be an
event, which is the case if the chunk has a head, the head is a common noun and
the chunk is not a time expression. Next, it checks whether the noun chunk can
semantically be an event. It does this by looking up the head token in Wordnet
and by running a simple Bayesian classifier. This is where the heavy lifting
occurs. The general logic is as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>If all senses of the head token of the chunk are events in WordNet, return
True.</li>

<li>Else, if the classifier has enough data for the head token in its
statistical model, let the classifier decide whether the token is an event.</li>

<li>Else, do another WordNet lookup and check either whether the primary sense
is an event or whether some senses are events.</li>

</ol>

<p>The exact application of this logic is driven by settings in the
components.evita.settings module, which has a couple of variable that determine
whether the Bayesian classifier is used and how WordNet lookup determines
event-hood.

<pre class="example indent">
<i>components.evita.settings</i>

EVITA_NOM_DISAMB = True
EVITA_NOM_CONTEXT = True
EVITA_NOM_WNPRIMSENSE_ONLY = True
</pre>

<p>The first variable determines whether the classifier will actually apply and
the second whether the classifier will take into account contextual features (as
opposed to just the word). The third variable determines the choice to be made
in step 3, the default is to decide that a token is an event if its primary
sense is.</p>

<p>The resources used by the logic above are in library/evita/dictionaries. Here
is a short desciption of the WordNet and classifier resources.</p>

<ul class="spacy">

<li>For WordNet lookup, three files are used:

<ol class="tight">
<li>wnAllSensesAreEvents.txt contains the nouns for which all senses are events,
<li>wnPrimSenseIsEvent.txt contains the nouns for which the primary sense is an
event,
<li>wnSomeSensesAreEvents.txt contains the nouns for which some sense is an
event.
</ol>

Note that the second file includes all nouns in the first and that the third
file contains all nouns in the second. WordNet lookup is a binary search through
these files. The files were created by library/evita/build_event_nominals1.py,
which uses the third party module wntools. This script has not been used or
tested in almost 10 years. There is also a script named
library/evita/build_event_nominals2.py, which takes these files and creates
Python dbm files for them, which may improve speed a bit. In a not-so-distant
future, we will probably load these files into an in-memory dictionary at Tarsqi
startup time (or load them from a pickle file).

</li>

<li>

For the Bayesian classifier, there are two pickle files, both in
library/evita/dictionaries, that contain Python dictionaries with the statistics
used. The statistics were taken from TimeBank and Semcor, two corpora with event
information for nominals. The first file, semcorNomEvent.pickle, contains raw
counts for 2638 nominals and lists the number of non-event occurrences and the
number of event occurrences. Here is a fragment of the Python dictionary in that
pickle file:

<pre class="example indent">
'drawing': [12.0, 2.0],
'negligence': [0, 2.0],
'detail': [33.0, 9.0],
'absorption': [0, 7.0],
'crack': [6.0, 1.0],
</pre>

From this fragment you can read that there were 12 occurrences where 'drawing'
was not an event and 2 occurrences where it was. (By the way, it is not clear
why these numbers are floats, probably a historical accident).

<p/>

The file semcorNomEventContextProb.pickle contains probability adjustments for
the nominals given a small amount of features (definite versus indefinite and
singular versus plural). The numbers are adjustments for the non-event
probability and the event probability respectively. Adjustments for two of the
nominals above are given below.

<pre class="example indent">
'drawing': {
	'DEF': (0.1, 0.1),
	'INDEF': (0.9, 0.9),
	'NN': (0.34, 0.9),
	'NNS': (0.66, 0.1) }

'absorption': {
	'DEF': (0.5, 0.166666),
	'INDEF': (0.5, 0.833333),
	'NNS': (0.5, 0.3),
	'NN': (0.5, 0.7) }
</pre>

For example, if we take 'drawing', which has a proability of 0.14 of being an
event and 0.86 of not being an event, and say that we have the features INDEF
and NN, then the adjusted event probability would be 0.14 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.11 and
the adjusted non-event probability would be 0.86 * 0.9 * 0.34 = 0.20, after which
the adjusted chance of not being an event is still bigger. Note that the
combined probabilities are not 1 anymore.

<p/>

There is some ancient code in library/evita/nominal_trainer.py which does
not work, but which was originally used to create the pickle files. The content
of the pickle files is also listed in a friendlier format in files with the .txt
extension in the same directory.

</li>

</ul>

<p>Back to the Evita nominal event logic. If the isEventCandidate() method
returns true then the _conditionallyAddEvent() method will perform a few last
checks and then add an event to the TarsqiDocument by asking the TarsqiTree to
do the honours:</p>

<pre class="example indent">
<i>components.common_modules.chunks.Chunk</i>

_conditionallyAddEvent(self, gramChunk=None):
    gchunk = self.gramchunk if gramChunk is None else gramChunk
    if (gchunk.head
        and gchunk.head.getText() not in forms.be
        and gchunk.head.getText() not in forms.spuriousVerb
        and gchunk.evClass):
        self.tree.addEvent(Event(gchunk))
</pre>

<p>This method is defined on Chunk and is used by VerbChunks as well. The core
is to invoke addEvent() on the TarsqiTree instance in the tree variable, handing
it an Event instance which was created from the GramNChunk (or GramVChunk for
verb chunks).</p>

<pre class="example indent">
<i>components.common_modules.tree.TarsqiTree</i>

addEvent(self, event):
    event_attrs = dict(event.attrs)
    eid = self.tarsqidoc.next_event_id()
    eiid = "ei%s" % eid[1:]
    event_attrs['eid'] = eid
    event_attrs['eiid'] = eiid
    token = event.tokens[-1]
    self.tarsqidoc.add_event(token.begin, token.end, event_attrs)
</pre>

<p>The TarsqiTree instance is handed most event features (tense and aspect and
so on), but it is responsible for generating unique identifiers for the event
(which it gets from the TarsqiDocument). Finally, it asks the TarsqiDocument to
add the tag to the tags TagRepository, thereby exporting the component results
as shown in the picture earlier in this section.</p>
