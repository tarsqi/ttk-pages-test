<div class="title">module ttk_path</div>

<pre>
Provides root directory and adds utilities directory to path

Get the directory the script runs from and add the directories with ttk modules to the
Python search path, inserting them after the current directory. This script needs to be in
the same directory as ttk.py, the main python TTK script. I would really like this to be
done in the main tarsqi.py script.

Other modules can use the following to get at the root directory:

    from ttk_path import TTK_ROOT

Extending the path used to be how all imports were done, which was rather moronic. The
only holdout is the utilities directory. This is because all FSA's in patterns were
compiled while using the old system, need to keep it until all FSA are recompiled.</pre>
