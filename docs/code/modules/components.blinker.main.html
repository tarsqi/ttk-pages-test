<div class="title">module components.blinker.main</div>

<pre>
<a href=#Blinker>Blinker</a>
</pre>

<pre>
Main module for Blinker, the rule-based Tlink generation component.

Responsible for loading the libraries and other top-level processing.</pre>


<a name="Blinker"/><div class="section">class Blinker</div>
<pre>
<strong>Inherits from: <a href=components.common_modules.component.html#TarsqiComponent>TarsqiComponent</a></strong></strong>

Implements the Blinker component of Tarsqi. Blinker takes the shallow
tree implemented in the TarsqiTree object and applies rules that capture
regularities between events and times as well as between events.

Instance variables:
   NAME         -  a string
   dct          -  document creation time: a string of the form YYYYMMDD
   rules        -  a BlinkerRuleDictionary
   rule2_index  -  a dictionary, quick access to type 2 rules
   tarsqidoc    -  a TarsqiDOcument
   doctree      -  a TarsqiTree</pre>

<blockquote>
<h3>Public Functions</h3>
<pre>
<div class=function>__init__(self, tarsqidoc)</div>
Set component name and load rules into a BlinkerRuleDictionary
object, this object knows where the rules are stored.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>process_element(self, element)</div>
Apply the Blinker rules to the element. Creates a TarsqiTree instance
and then applies the Blinker rules.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>run_timex_linking(self)</div>
Apply the rules that govern relations between TIMEX3 tags. Only
applies to TIMEX3 tags with type=DATE.</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3>Private Functions</h3>
<pre>
<div class=function>_add_tlink(self, reltype, id1, id2, source)</div>
Add a TLINK to self.tarsqidoc.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_apply_event_anchoring_rules(self, sentence, timex, i)</div>
Anchor events to a given timex that occurs in the sentence at index
i. The method proceeds by looking for some simple syntactic patterns
with and without prepositions. If a pattern with a preposition occurs,
then the preposition is looked up in self.rule2_index. If no signal is
found, then the default INCLUDES rule will apply (rule 1), this is not
yet implemented.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_apply_event_ordering_with_signal_rules(self)</div>
Some more rules without using any rules, basically a placeholder
for event ordering rules that use a signal.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_apply_type3_rules(self, event1, event2)</div>
Creates a TLINK between two main events</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_apply_type5_rules(self, sentence, event1, position)</div>
Creates TLINKs between the reporting event and reported events

Takes as arguments sentence, reporting event constituent, and
position of that constituent within the sentence list</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_create_timex_link(self, timex1, timex2)</div>
Try to create a TLINK between two timexes.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_index_rules(self)</div>
Rules of type 2 (timex-signal-event) can be simply put in a hash
keyed on the signals.</pre>
<pre>
<div class=function>_run_blinker(self)</div>
Apply BLinker rules to the sentences in the doctree variable. This
currently only deals with rule type 2, anchoring an event to a timex in
those cases where there is a signal (that is, a preposition). New
Tlinks are added just before the closing tag of the fragment.</pre>
