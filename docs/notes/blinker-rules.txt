
BLINKER TEMPORAL RULES
======================

The temporal rules in Blinker are taken from the GutenLink rule
set. GutenLink uses seven kinds of rules, each operating on particular
pairs of objects:

	1- applies to intra-sentential event-timex pairs
	2- applies to intra-sentential event-timex pairs, but only if a
		signal is present
	3- applies to main events of consectutive sentences
	4- applies to reporting events and the document creation time (DCT)
	5- applies to intra-sentential event-event pairs where one of the
		events is a reporting event
	6- applies to intra-sentential event-event pairs 
	7- applies to any pair of timexes where both timexes are marked as
		document creation times or publication times

Each rule defines three types of features:

	1- features that are local to one of the 
value pairs
The rule types are explained in more detail below.


Rule 1: EVENT - TIMEX
=====================

These rules apply to intra-sentential EVENT-TIMEX3 pairs. There may or
may not be a signal between the event and the timex.


Implied Features:

 - arg1.tag = EVENT
 - arg2.tag = TIMEX3
 - signal = NO
 - sameSentence = YES

Other features:

 - distance = -1 | 1	
	1 if event is before timex, -1 otherwise
 - relation = <TimemlRel>	
	any timeml relation, always IS_INCLUDED in this case
 - confidence = <float>
	always 1 if rules have not been trained,
	otherwise a number from 0 to 1





==> Rule 2: EVENT - SIGNAL - TIMEX

- intra-sentential EVENT-TIMEX3 pairs
- SIGNAL occuring between EVENT and TIMEX3


==> Rule 3: MAIN_EVENT - MAIN_EVENT

Applies to:
- Two EVENTS that are both the first event in consecutive sentences


==> Rule 4: REPORTING_EVENT - DCT

Add temporal links between reporting events and the DCT, assumes
(incorrectly) that all reporting events are included in the DCT.

Applies to:
- Each reporting verb and document time


==> Rule 5: REPORTING_EVENT - EVENT

Looks at subordinated contexts with reporting verb.

Applies to:
- REPORTING and EVENT in same sentence
- REPORTING occurs before EVENT?

Features:
	sentType=DIRECT or INDIRECT
	arg1.class=REPORTING
	arg2.class=STATE or other thing except REPORTING
	arg1.tense='PAST', 'PRESENT', 'FUTURE','NONE'
	arg2.tense=
	arg1.aspect='PROGRESS', 'PERFECT', 'PERFECT', 'NONE'


==> Rule 6: EVENT - EVENT

Applies to:
- two events in the same sentence.


==> Rule 7: DCT - DCT

Creates identity links between TIMEX3 tags that have CREATION_TIME
or PUBLICATION_TIME as the value of functionInDocument.

Applies to:
- all TIMEX3 pairs with "PUBLICATION_TIME" or "CREATION_TIME" as a
  value of functionInDocument.
